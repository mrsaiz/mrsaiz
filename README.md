### What I do 👨‍💻

A Development Platform, cloud-based, that provides a complete development environment for our teams. It includes all the tools necessary to develop, test, and deploy applications quickly and efficiently. Our platform is built on top of AWS services like Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), Elastic Container Service (ECS), RDS, Lambda, etc...

To orchestrate the process I use technologies like Terraform, Helm, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, ArgoCD.
